# ⚽ Query your A.I. about FIFA Soccer Rules ⚽

## Introduction
 
This repository houses a codebase that leverages NLP techniques to create an interactive chat application that answers queries about FIFA soccer rules. The code is in Python and uses Langchain and Streamlit library to create an engaging and user-friendly web application.

The core of this project is the Langchain Conversational Retrieval Chain, a sophisticated AI model that retrieves accurate answers to user queries. This model is trained on a FIFA soccer rules dataset and can answer a wide range of questions about the game's regulations. The model's responses are accurate and provide the source documents as references for further reading.

My goal is to provide a comprehensive example of how to build an AI-powered chat application, guiding you through each step, from setting up the Streamlit session states, handling form submissions, retrieving and processing the AI responses to creating an interactive chat interface.

Whether you're a beginner just starting with NLP or an experienced developer looking for inspiration for your next project, this repository is valuable. We encourage you to explore the code, try running it on your local machine, and let us know if you have any questions or feedback. Happy coding!
